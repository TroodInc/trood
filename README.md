## 🎯 Vision  
We aim to **automate project analysis** and leverage AI to **deliver precise, context-aware debugging recommendations** — making development faster and more efficient.

Trood CLI solves two major problems:

🚀 **Being alone in debugging** – No more wasting hours figuring things out alone. While AI can assist in generating code, it is not always efficient at solving complex issues.
⏳ **Scaling the team under pressure** – When you’re beyond the deadline, it’s complicated to efficiently bring in new people to solve specific problems. Trood CLI acts as an on-demand debugging assistant, helping you move forward without delays.

## 🔮 What’s Next?
We’re building beyond debugging. Our next step is to integrate the repository with:

🔗 [Trood Business/Development Manager](https://trood.com/bdm) – for full-scale integration of **business and product architecture, CI/CD, QA, and code management.**
👥 [Trood Community](https://trood.com/launchpad) – to seamlessly **find, engage, and reward** human support from people with **best-matching skills.**
This repository will be the foundation of the AI CTO we are building.

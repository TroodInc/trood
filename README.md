Welcome to Trood CLI, an AI-powered debugging tool that redefines troubleshooting by detecting and solving potential issues before they screw up your production.

---

## Vision  

Our goal is to **make project analysis easier**, **give accurate debugging suggestions**, and **unite teams** helping developers work faster and more efficiently.

Trood CLI solves two main problems:

1. **Debugging alone**. No more wasting time trying to figure things out by yourself. While AI can assist in generating code, itâ€™s not always efficient at eliminating the bugs it createsâ€”yet.
2. **Scaling under pressure**. Deadlines are tight, and itâ€™s hard to bring in new people fast. Trood CLI helps by finding known issues and summarizing the results, saving you time and reducing the cost of delays.

## What We Offer

Trood CLI is designed to tackle the most frustrating and time-consuming challenges developers face every day. It:
- **identifies current and potential issues** in your project before bugs make it to production;
- **analyzes project's environment** â€“ searches for potential dependency conflicts and known issues;
- **saves your time** by aggregating information from various resources;
- **engages community experts** with **relevant skillset** providing them with only the data needed to quickly solve your problem;
- and **delivers a comprehensive project health report** to keep you posted.

## What's Next?

We're building beyond debugging. Our next step is to integrate the repository with:

- [Trood Business/Development Manager](https://trood.com/bdm), for full-scale integration of **business and product architecture, CI/CD, QA, and code management.**
- [Trood Community](https://trood.com/launchpad), to seamlessly **find, engage, and reward** human support from people with **best-matching skills.**

This repository will be the foundation of the AI CTO we are building ðŸ‘€

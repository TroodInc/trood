Welcome to Trood CLI, an AI-powered debugging tool that redefines troubleshooting by detecting and solving potential issues before they screw up your production.

---

## 🔍 What We Offer

Trood CLI is designed to tackle the most frustrating and time-consuming challenges developers face every day, it:
- **identifies current and potential issues** in your project before bugs 🐞 make it to production;
- **analyzes project's environment** – searches for potential dependency conflicts and known issues;
- **saves your time** by aggregating information from various resources;
- and **delivers a comprehensive project health report** to keep you posted.

## 🌅 Vision  

Our goal is to **make project analysis easier** and use AI to **give accurate debugging suggestions**, helping developers work faster and more efficiently.

Trood CLI solves two main problems:

> 🪅 Debugging alone – No more wasting time trying to figure things out by yourself. While AI can assist in generating code, it’s not always efficient at eliminating the bugs it creates—yet.

> ⏳ Scaling under pressure – Deadlines are tight, and it’s hard to bring in new people fast. Trood CLI helps by finding known issues and summarizing the results, saving you time and reducing the cost of delays.

## 🔮 What's Next?

We're building beyond debugging. Our next step is to integrate the repository with:

- 🔗 [Trood Business/Development Manager](https://trood.com/bdm) – for full-scale integration of **business and product architecture, CI/CD, QA, and code management.**
- 👥 [Trood Community](https://trood.com/launchpad) – to seamlessly **find, engage, and reward** human support from people with **best-matching skills.**

This repository will be the foundation of the AI CTO we are building. 👀

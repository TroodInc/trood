# What is Trood?
  
Trood is like an **AI-powered software architect + DevOps engineer** combined into one system. Instead of manually setting up infrastructure, picking frameworks, and managing teams, Trood does this **automatically** through its AI-driven orchestration system. When you install Trood, you get:

1. **A Server + Web Client**  
   - The **backend** is an AI-driven orchestration system that manages software development tasks.  
   - The **frontend** (web interface) is where users interact with AI-driven workflows, configure projects, and manage software components.  

2. **Core Components & Entities**  
   - **Project** – The main unit where you define your software development goals.  
   - **Modules** – Pre-built software components (from open-source or custom code) that can be integrated into your project.  
   - **AI CTO** – A virtual AI-powered assistant that **analyzes your project needs, suggests architecture, and automates development tasks**.  
   - **Infrastructure Management** – Automates setting up cloud resources, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment processes.  
   - **Workflow Automation** – AI-driven planning, task distribution, and execution tracking.  
   - **Community Contributions** – Allows collaboration, sharing, and improvement of reusable software components.  

## What’s the Main Paradigm?  
Trood follows the **AI-driven software automation paradigm**, where the system:  
1. **Understands your requirements** (business goals, tech stack, infrastructure).  
2. **Suggests the optimal architecture** (choosing and integrating modules).  
3. **Automates software assembly** (deploying, testing, and maintaining components).  

## What Can You Do With Trood?  
- **Set up a project** and let AI **analyze, suggest, and integrate software components**.  
- **Automate DevOps** (configure cloud environments, CI/CD, monitoring).  
- **Reduce manual development** – AI handles much of the **architecture, module selection, and deployment**.  
- **Collaborate with a developer community** and reuse components from an open-source repository.  

## What problems does Trood solve?

1. **Dependency on Large Tech Teams**  
   - Traditional software development requires many engineers to manage **infrastructure, code, DevOps, and architecture**. Trood automates much of this through **AI-driven orchestration**, which analyzes project requirements, selects optimal software components, configures infrastructure, and integrates them into a working system **without manual intervention**.

2. **High Operational Costs (OPEX)**  
   - Keeping software running is expensive due to maintenance, scaling, and deployment efforts. Trood **automates CI/CD pipelines, optimizes cloud resource allocation, and detects inefficiencies**, reducing costs by minimizing manual labor and hardware waste.

3. **Complex Planning and Execution**  
   - Software projects suffer from **scope creep, delays, and inefficiencies**. Trood's AI-driven system helps by **analyzing historical project data, suggesting optimal workflows, and auto-generating software blueprints** that adapt to changes dynamically.

4. **Managing Overwhelming Complexity**  
   - Modern software development involves selecting from **millions of libraries, APIs, and frameworks**, which is beyond human capacity. Trood **uses AI to analyze dependencies, suggest optimal combinations, and automatically integrate components** to build a scalable, maintainable architecture.

## 📌 Repository Roadmap

Unlike our [Trood Product Roadmap](ROADMAP.md), which focuses on end-user solutions, this roadmap details **how this metarepository will evolve** and what developers can do to contribute.

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Current Stage)**

✅ Establish core structure with categorized repositories  
✅ Reformant and add solutions of Trood Development Team  
✅ Collect and organize high-quality existing solutions

### **Phase 2: Community & Expansion**

🟡 Expand the repository with contributions from external developers  
🟡 Develop a rating/review system for contributed solutions  
🟡 Build an automated indexing and metadata system  
🟡 Integrate CI/CD to validate new contributions automatically

### **Phase 3: AI-Driven Code Retrieval**

🔵 Implement AI-powered code search & recommendation engine  
🔵 Develop APIs for programmatic access to the metarepository  
🔵 Train AI models on structured solutions for code assembly

### **Phase 4: Fully Automated AI Development**

🔴 Enable AI-driven software development using repository assets  
🔴 Create an intelligent agent that assembles software autonomously  
🔴 Provide end-to-end development automation for businesses
